## Katie and Nadira's Tech Talk Takeaways
### [Tech Talk 3: Accounts and Logins](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csp/wiki/Tri-3-TT3--Accounts-and-Login)
 The csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com implementation of accounts and logins is great, but it has some security flaws. We believe that the csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com password creation should use two-factor authentication when logging in. This is because csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com needs an extra layer of security for its users as every user is displayed with their username, email, and phone number on the Table Viewer on the SQL CRUD dropdown.
